This project is a dynamic, real-time disease simulation built with Python.

You can model multiple diseases simultaneously and adjust a wide range of parameters — including infection rate, vaccination, and quarantine — while the simulation is running. The simulation is fully interactive: small changes can drastically alter how an outbreak unfolds, allowing you to explore concepts like exponential growth, herd immunity, and the fragility of complex systems.

[Have fun!](
